  \caption{Photometric fitting of UGC09629 incorporating an exponential and a Sérsic model for the galaxy and an additional Sérsic model for the luminous bulb near the center of the galaxy, supplemented with elliptical isophote profile analysis. The reduced $\chi^2$ for the overall fit was 2.50. Image description is the same as Figure 2 in the main text.}
